# Analytical Methods and Data Science

Welcome to the codespace for the course Analytical Methods and Data Science. This template is fully equipped with all packages, data, and content that is needed for the course.

The material provides an introduction into analytical methods for supply chain management, including data engineering, visualization, machine learning, time series analysis, mathmatical optimization, and dashboard building. Students will get a hands-on experience with widely used Python libraries, such as Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, as well as lesser known tools, such as Polars, Panel, and OR-tools. 

Everything you need is contained within this one codespace. The codespace provides a starting point to begin solving real world problems using data and algorithms for decision-making.

There is no repository on GitHub yet. While your codespace will remain active for quite a while, Github deletes it after a period of inactivity. Once your codespace is deleted, all your changes are gone forever.  Therefore, if and when youâ€™re ready click "Publish Branch" and Github will create create your repository and push up your project, so that your own changes are stored and saved.
